List of morton std::maps for each level
morton<MAX>, morton<MAX-2>, morton<MAX-4>, etc. ?

Flag for leaf nodes, non leaf nodes are still stored at lower levels.
 
Searching functions are the same. Start searches at level above. 

Now can do time update level by level. 
Refinement tagging also level by level, starting at max level. Can auto set next level up if refined neighbor is tagged. 



Patch objects need to store coarse/fine flux correction arrays.
